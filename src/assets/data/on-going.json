    "description": "The Abyss is a digital distribution game platform with a strong accent on F2P browser and client MMO games that provides an opportunity for developers and players to earn from referral and motivation programs and other activities. The main difference between The Abyss and other digital distribution game platforms will be the introduction of referral and motivational programs. By inviting friends to the platform, users will create their own referral networks. Players will earn from all the payments and activities of their referrals. Developers, in turn, will receive70% of all payments made in their games, and the share of payments of their players and referrals in any other game on the platform.1/3 of the platform's net revenue from user payments will be distributed to the five-level referral programs",
